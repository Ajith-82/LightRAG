# Test Outputs

This directory contains output files generated by various tests and validation scripts.

## Contents

Test outputs are automatically generated and saved here during testing to keep them organized and easily accessible for review.

### File Naming Convention

- `{feature}_test_output_{format}.txt` - Test outputs for specific features
- `{test_name}_results_{timestamp}.log` - Test execution logs
- `{component}_validation_{date}.json` - Validation results

## Current Files

Files in this directory are generated by:
- Enhanced Docling configuration tests
- API integration validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Content quality analysis

## Cleanup

Test output files can be safely removed as they are regenerated during testing. However, they may be useful for:
- Debugging test failures
- Comparing output quality between versions
- Performance analysis
- Documentation examples

## Automation

Test outputs are automatically organized here by the testing framework to prevent cluttering the main project directory.
