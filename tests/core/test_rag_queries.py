            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create systems

            is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being 
            explicitly programmed for every scenario.
            
            Deep Learning, a specialized branch of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks 
            with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Popular deep learning 
            architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and 
            Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data.
            
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another important AI field that focuses on enabling 
            computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Modern NLP systems use 
            transformer architectures like BERT and GPT for various language tasks.

            Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering 
            algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering group similar data points. Dimensionality 
            reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE help visualize high-dimensional data.
            
            Reinforcement learning trains agents to make sequences of decisions by learning from rewards
